Much have been said regarding the benefits of writing. 

> So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.

From [Writes And Write-Nots](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html). 

I find myself increasingly reliant on LLMs for thinking. To force myself to think deep, I am starting this website to write more. I do not expect much of an audience, but the potential for an audience will hopefully force me to polish and thus think more. 

I also believe that writing well requires reading more. To write well, I need to draw on quality information sources.  However, reading more without retention is inefficient. In order to ensure I retain key takeaways from my readings, I aim to summarize my day-to-day readings on the Readings section of this website.
