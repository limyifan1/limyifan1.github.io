Much have been said regarding the benefits of writing. 

> So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.

From [Writes And Write-Nots](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html). 

I find myself increasingly reliant on LLMs for thinking. To force myself to think deep, I am starting this website to write more. I do not expect much of an audience, but the potential for an audience will hopefully force me to polish and thus think more. 

I also believe that writing well requires reading more. However, reading in itself is not enough. Firstly, reading relevant and high-quality information is important.  Secondly, reading more with high information retention is key. Finding high-quality sources of information is still a WIP. To ensure I retain key takeaways from my readings, I aim to summarize my day-to-day readings on the [Readings](https://limyifan1.github.io/index.html) section of this website.
