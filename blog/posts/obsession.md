But what is it about obsession that lead to outsized success? Here are some of my hypotheses. 

## Subconscious
The human brain works both consciously and subconsciously. Obsession allows a thought to continue working in the background. This "background processing" provide more opportunity for a stimulus to trigger a novel connection. 

## Quality
Obsession leads to repeated iteration and more attempts at getting things right. When you get more shots at polishing an idea/product, you fill in more details and trim the rough edges. 

## Magnitude
More input is a natural extension to at least more outcomes. Obsession leads an individual to perform tedious tasks that others might avoid. 

## Compounding
Effort input and output is not simply linear. With more thought, compounding can occur via connections between ideas and establishment of intuition.
