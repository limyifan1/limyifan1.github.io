## Weekly Readings
### Week of August 4, 2025

* [Agents are not tools](https://discuss.google.dev/t/agents-are-not-tools/192812) - A tool is something that can be asked to take an action, can be awaited for completion of the action, and can report errors. The agent is not a tool, it is a problem solver. The key difference between agent flow and tool flow is that the action is not guaranteed to be completed upon return.
* [How to write a good design document](https://grantslatton.com/how-to-design-document) - Write one idea per paragraph that flows to each other. Each paragraph can be condensed into one sentence by the reader.
* [There Are No New Ideas in AIâ€¦ Only New Datasets](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-are-no-new-ideas-in-ai-only) - Many fundamental ideas already exist since decades ago, the main breakthrough is new data (e.g. ImagetNet, Web)
* [Vibe coding in prod](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk) - Vibe coding is suitable for 'leaf nodes'. Act as a PM for the AI where you validate outputs and tests instead of seeing each line of code.
* [AI Agents: Less Capability, More Reliability, Please](https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/reliability-vs-capability) - Agents now often have high variance in quality. Reliability, transparency, and predictability are key.
* [Writes and Write-Notes](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html) - Writing is hard. But writing is thinking. More and more people will rely on LLMs to write, causing less and less people to think. 
* [Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) - Important to keep things simple. 3 patterns: augmented LLMs, workflow, agent. Workflows are for predefined problems. Agents are for open-ended problems. Common workflows: Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, Evaluator-Optimizer.
