## Weekly Readings
### Week of August 4, 2025

* [Agents are not tools](https://discuss.google.dev/t/agents-are-not-tools/192812) - A tool is something that can be asked to take an action, can be awaited for completion of the action, and can report errors. The agent is not a tool, it is a problem solver. The key difference between agent flow and tool flow is that the action is not guaranteed to be completed upon return.
* [How to write a good design document](https://grantslatton.com/how-to-design-document) - Write one idea per paragraph that flows to each other. Each paragraph can be condensed into one sentence by the reader.
* [There Are No New Ideas in AIâ€¦ Only New Datasets](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-are-no-new-ideas-in-ai-only) - Many fundamental ideas already exist since decades ago, the main breakthrough is new data (e.g. ImagetNet, Web)
* [Vibe coding in prod](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk) - Vibe coding is suitable for 'leaf nodes'. Act as a PM for the AI where you validate outputs and tests instead of seeing each line of code.
* [AI Agents: Less Capability, More Reliability, Please](https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/reliability-vs-capability) - Agents now often have high variance in quality. Reliability, transparency, and predictability are key.
* [Writes and Write-Notes](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html) - Writing is hard. But writing is thinking. More and more people will rely on LLMs to write, causing less and less people to think. 
* [Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) - Important to keep things simple. 3 patterns: augmented LLMs, workflow, agent. Workflows are for predefined problems. Agents are for open-ended problems. Common workflows: Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, Evaluator-Optimizer. 
* [Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl directives](https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/) - Perplexity ignores robots.txt/WAF while OpenAI does. Easily verifiable via a new fake domain. Even after getting blocked, crawlers rotate IPs repeatedly. 
* [Agents or Bots? Making Sense of AI on the Open Web](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/1952531537385456019) - Perplexity response to Cloudflare. Core argument is that digital assistants are different from scrapers. Digital assistants are "helpful". Scrapers are "malicious". 
* [Hire people who give a shit.](https://alexw.substack.com/p/hire) - Hiring people based on whether they care about the company & their own work is important. Find people who can be obsessive. 
* [Stripe's Payment API: The first 10 years](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design) - Started with simple cards that don't require user action, hence based on Charges and Sources. Use writing hypothetical integration guides as a design tool to validate concepts and prevent pits of failure. A great API product stays out of the developer's way for as long as possible. 
* [The Top Idea In Your Mind](https://www.paulgraham.com/top.html) - We usually have a top-of-mind idea we drift to. The direction of this idea is not easy to control, but can be changed via what situations we let ourselves get into. Conflict and money can often become top-of-mind (undesirably) but we should acknowledge it and learn to avoid. 
* [My Lethal Trifecta talk at the Bay Area AI Security Meetup](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/) - Lethal Trifecta: 1) Access to private data 2) Ability to communicate externally 3) Exposure to untrusted content. Removing one of the legs will help.
