Hi, I'm a software engineer based in Singapore.

## Weekly Readings
### Week of August 4, 2025

* [Agents are not tools](https://discuss.google.dev/t/agents-are-not-tools/192812) - A tool is something that can be asked to take an action, can be awaited for completion of the action, and can report errors. The agent is not a tool, it is a problem solver. The key difference between agent flow and tool flow is that the action is not guaranteed to be completed upon return.
* [How to write a good design document](https://grantslatton.com/how-to-design-document) - Write one idea per paragraph that flows to each other. Each paragraph can be condensed into one sentence by the reader.
